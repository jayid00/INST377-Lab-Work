    <h2>What is Post-Rock?</h2>

    <p>
      Post-rock is a sub-genre of Rock music that mostly deals with ambient and
      instrumrntal music. Here are some notable characteristic of post-rock:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Mostly instrumental but may contain vocal</li>
      <li>Has a strong emphasis on ambient sound and white noise</li>
      <li>Incorporates other genres of Rock</li>
      <li>
        Music can range from mild/easy-listening to something hardcore like
        heavy metal
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      I've been listenin to a lot of post-rock for the last few years. Here's a
      list of some of my favorite post-rock albums:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Happy Songs For Happy People by Mogwai</li>

    <h2>Interesting Post-Rock Trivia</h2>

    <p>
      Post-rock is <em>not too mainstream</em> and is often considered a
      <em><strong>CULT</strong></em> genre.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although post-rock mostly includes instrumental music, it wouldn't be
      correct to simply call it instrumental music.<br />
      Bands like <strong>Sigur Ros</strong> and
      <strong>Caspian</strong> incorporates vocals in their music in a way that
      adds a new layer of dynamic in their music.
